# IHMC Gradle Build Plugin in Kotlin

Conversion of our build plugin to Kotlin. Very active development.

Gradle Plugin Site: https://plugins.gradle.org/plugin/us.ihmc.build.ihmc-build

## Goals

- Get strongly typed build scripts working in IntelliJ and Eclipse
- Utilize composite builds to make each project standalone by default
- Keep Bamboo CI configuration powerful, minimal, and flexible
